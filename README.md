>Misc Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects and experiments. It serves as a sandbox for learning, practicing, and exploring different ideas as I continue developing my skills.

Current Projects:

A simple web page for displaying recipes. The project focuses on building a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, with plans to extend into JavaScript later.

>Note
Each project lives in its own directory.

Documentation, notes, or supporting files for a project will be kept alongside its source code.


>Planned area to Explore:

Frontend web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Small Python utilities

General coding experiments
